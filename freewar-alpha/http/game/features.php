Here are the Features, which will make FreeWar, the unique RTS it should...<br>
<br>
This page is far from static, and is very likely to be updated, so come back to check it<br>
every now and then. You can even add you own features ;)<br>
<br>
<br>
- FreeWar is Free ;)<br>
It is currently under devellopment by computer enthusiasts and gamers.<br>
Its coded by gamers, for gamers.<br>
Our goal, is to make an excellent game, fun, totally innovating, and totally free.<br>
<br>
- Its portablility/compatibility.<br>
Freewar will be ported and therefore playable on more than<br>
<a title="Compatibility" href="?page=os">15 different Architectures and Operating Systems.</a><br>
Including well known systems such as Windows, Linux, Mac, Solaris and BSD.<br>
<br>
- Its "GameSpaces". This new concept (which unix users might be familiar with) introduces<br>
multiple gaming windows. It's like having multiple desktops. Each one of these GameSpaces<br>
can be of totally different nature. For instance, you may have one looking at your base,<br>
another at combat, a third one building units, another one displaying the game-menu, and so on...<br>
This will save alot of scrolling and moreover, alot of time.<br>
<br>
These same GameSpaces can then be "cut" into smaller GameSpaces. There again, each one becomes<br>
totally independent from the other. So you can cut up your GameSpace, into 2 more, or 3, or 4 or<br>
however many you need to be productive.<br>
Taking our preceding example, your third GameSpace, could be cut into 4 smaller ones. One<br>
watching over unit-production, another on defences, another on harvesters and food gathering,<br>
the possibilities are endless.<br>
<br>
-Its Package system. Letting FreeWar players <b>very</b> easily add new features such as new<br>
races, new units, new maps, new mods, etc<br>
<br>
- Its interaction with the environment. Every object you see on a map may be used, destroyed,<br>
modified, re-created, etc.<br>
Each element with have multiple uses depending on which race you decide to play with.<br>
For instance wood may be used as fuel, a spell could be cast to create a unit,<br>
it could be asborbed to increase mana-resources, or you could plant it to grow more trees.<br>
These sorts of interations may be possible with all the elements on the map (water, stone<br>
minerals, animals, etc) depending on the race played.<br>
For example, a forest may be cut down to stop an opposing race using it as a mana-resource, or worse still,<br>
enchanting the entire region and using the units created against you.<br>
The diverse nature of the resources make the game more of a challenge, to defend againts the<br>
many scenarios that may arise while playing.<br>
<br>
-Its <b>extreme</b> configuration. You can change practically every aspect of your gaming experience.<br>
From skinning your HUD, putting an avatar to be recognized while online, to creating you own<br>
commands. This configuration will be stored in simple text files, with an easy to use syntax<br>
therfore hand-editable, and you may copy these for a re-installation, moving to a mate's, or going<br>
to a LAN party and you'll find yourself right at home, with all your GameSpaces, shortcuts, options,<br>
anything you configured, will be there.<br>
<br>
-Its simple configuration files syntax. Simple syntax will be used in configuration files meaning<br>
you can hand-edit them without being a guru. This simple syntax will also be used to create scripts.<br>
This by nature means that it will easy to create scripts for repetitive actions,<br>
so there is more time to concentrate on strategy, making the game proceed at a quicker pace.<br>
For instance, you could create a script wich selects all your farmers, sends them to get food,
and builds another 5 back at base.<br>
You can combine all the above features. Example: you could assign your scripts to a hotkey,<br>
and execute them at the press of a single button.<br>
