So...FreeWar, Freewar.... But what exactly IS FreeWar?<br>
If you're not sure, this text if for you ;)<br>
<br>
FreeWar is a video game. Yes, a simple video game, but unlike<br>
any of the ones you've played!<br>
If you're fed up with RTS (RTS=Real Time Strategy) games like StarCraft,<br>
AoK, Warcraft and the likes, which more or less, ressemble each other alot, then<br>
FreeWar is made for you!<br>
So... you're thinking... what makes FreeWar so special? The Answer lies<br>
in its <a title="Features" href="?page=features">Features</a>.<br>
These features are in constant evolution, and awaiting your own ideas.<br>
FreeWar is made by gamers, for gamers so feedback from the gamers is what will help<br>
it stay alive and rich.<br>
<br>
Once we feel the game has grown to maturity, the full sources will be released. Rendering the game<br>
fully Open-Source. It will be placed under a GPL licence, and many will know what this means ;)<br>
In case you don't, picture the idea that ANYONE with the right skills and knowledge will be able<br>
to change the game. From optimizing the code, to adding totally new features.<br>
However, the system we are currently developping should allow anyone without prior programming<br>
knowledge to create new races, new units or maps, through our package system (and easy scripting syntax :).<br>
<br>
It will obviously be network-aware so you may take on your foe on a LAN or throught the internet.<br>
We are also planning on a dedicated server mode.<br>
<br>
You'll have noticed by looking at its <a title="Features" href="?page=features">Features</a>,<br>
this game's strong points will be its flexibility, its durability, and its ease-of-use for any gamer.<br>
<br>
